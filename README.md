## General Info 
This project was created as part of a group project for a human web interfaces course. The UI was built for a real estate web application using the ASP.NET framework as chosen by a member of the group. My role in the group was to design the web app and translate those designs into code while the others would work on presenting my design to a 'client'. 

## Technologies 
This application was created with: 
* HTML/CSS/Javascript
* C#
* ASP.NET Web Framework 
* Azure
